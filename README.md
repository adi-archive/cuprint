A project to make printing at Columbia University super-duper easy

WISH LIST
================================================================================

 - Drag-n-drop!
 - Android interface!
 - Dynamic re-routing!
 - Maybe we could scrape the queue, and figure out if printers get heavily used during certain times
 - We can use rate of add to queue/rate of prints from queue/number of computers occupied in a lab to estimate load on a printer
 - Actually, printers aren't that sexy
 - Autocomplete UNIs? Only 8000 undergrads, prefix sharing should be usefully low
 - Geolocate (ish?) to estimate nearest printer
